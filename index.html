                        She's perfect in every way. Her body is to die for; her intelligence is off the charts. She's a
                        gorgeous actress, a marvelous writer and a beautiful human being. I want her.<br><br>
                        I need her.<br><br>
                        I wish, oh how I wish she would notice me.<br><br>
                        I'm always there for her, at every celebration, every birthday and every achievement, I am there
                        for her.<br><br>
                        I'm also there for every heart break, every tragedy and every misstep, I am there for her.<br><br>
                        Why won't she notice me?<br><br>
                        How I wish I knew what to do to make her notice me. I've written a few letters and gotten no
                        replies. I managed to get her phone number from her friend and left a voicemail or two but she
                        never calls back.<br><br>
                        I sat by the phone for days, waiting for a call the first time. The second time I had to
                        struggle through my day, acting normally, just to keep others from noticing how badly I was
                        affected.<br><br>
                        I love her, and I know she'd love me if she just would give me the time of day.<br><br>
                        I think of her every night, right before bed. I wish I could roll over and there she would be. I
                        could kiss her gently and whisper good night, or if she were in the mood, maybe a bit more than
                        a kiss, not that I'd be put out with just the good night.<br><br>
                        All I want is what everyone else wants, peace and happiness in my life. And those two are
                        distinctly absent without her. I have to figure out how to make her notice me. There has to be
                        some way. I just want to know that she realizes I exist, that's all really. I'd be happy with
                        that in all honesty, because I really can't fathom how she'd ever accept me as the monster I am.<br><br>
                        The wall is starting to fill up though, with ideas. Every time I come up with a new idea to make
                        her notice, I put it on the wall. There must be a dozen letters there, never mailed, that I
                        deemed too shoddy for this. Only the best prose and wit for her.<br><br>
                        It's morning now though, she'll be busy I suppose, so I'll just have to head for the office
                        right now, I have to make money somehow.<br><br>
                        Work isn't my true passion though, it never has been and it never will be, but it suits my needs
                        just fine. Working in a morgue isn't the most glamorous of jobs but it pays the bills and I
                        don't have to really deal with other people.<br><br>
                        Well, other living people that is.<br><br>
                        The dead can take a joke, unlike humans. They also don't try to torment me or make inane
                        conversation. They just, are.<br><br>
                        Work is what inspired my letters really, I was trying to figure out the best way to send a
                        message and as I came upon a stiff, I notice how much it looked like her. It had been a burst of
                        inspiration that almost blinded me really.<br><br>
                        The police didn't like it much; but some suffering has to come before my true art will shine. I
                        heard she didn't even try to guess at who was behind the first, or the second. It wasn't until
                        the fifth that she actually really made any response, and that was just a half-hearted plea for
                        me to reveal myself.<br><br>
                        But that's not part of the game. Our game. A little cat and mouse type of challenge. If she
                        really loved me, she'd know it was me and she'd just admit it, but not yet. More persuasion is
                        required.<br><br>
                        I'd already figured out the next message, this would be the first real one. The first true
                        message of my heart and soul. I'd prepared for ages, bought the supplies as discreetly as
                        possible and set it all up in an abandoned place that no one dared go. It was all set, now all I
                        needed to do was write the message.<br><br>
                        But, first, work. I was a regular guy really, just a bit socially deficit. Luckily I knew it, so
                        I could counter it enough to maintain a normal air during my time amongst the rabble of life.<br><br>
                        Tonight would be the first message in almost two weeks. The twelfth one and hopefully the last.
                        Hopefully, she'd finally sit up and take notice.<br><br>
                        Oh how I wish she'd notice, and then I'd be happy and content, even if she didn't say the words
                        back at first.<br><br>
                        As the day wore on, my patience grew short. I started snapping at any interruptions and I think
                        I might have reduced one widow to tears, I apologized but my boss had glared at me any way.
                        Clocking out would come soon and then I'd begin my letter to her.<br><br>
                        'First star I see tonight'
                        The time has finally come. I've found my canvas and prepared her. She lies naked on the table,
                        nowhere near as ethereal as my love, but blank enough for the work I need to do. The room is
                        cold and stark, a simple table and a separate tray lay in wait under a bright fluorescent light.
                        Her chest rises slightly, and then falls, simple deep breaths of a drugged sleep.<br><br>
                        I stare down at the canvas, watching as the letter takes shape in my mind. I can feel a smile
                        under the surgeon's mask I've donned. I had also taken the precaution to wear a full surgeon's
                        outfit, even the goofy looking cap had been included. I sighed as I came to the simple
                        conclusion that this would be the perfect canvas. Taking a scalpel, I slit her throat, no need
                        to let her suffer the pain of what I'm about to do.<br><br>
                        With meticulous precision born of long hours of practice, I retrieve the tattoo gun and set the
                        ink. All laid out in rows, with separate little cups for each color. I smile again as I noticed
                        I'd inadvertently chosen the same colors as my first letter to her. A coincidence, but a happy
                        one.<br><br>
                        I began to write my letter, starting just under the breast, I'd composed it properly so it would
                        fit the material I had been so lucky to acquire. I'd already left my signature within her, now
                        it was just a bit of times work to leave the message and then I'd be set. After that it'd be a
                        waiting game. The ink takes properly and sets quickly. I wipe the excess off every few minutes
                        to keep the letter fresh and stain free.<br><br>
                        The work of art took a few minutes to complete and as I step back I can admire my calligraphy.
                        Mother had always said my handwriting was pretty. It had been odd to know that this was a word
                        that could be applied to boys but then, I could see now that she was right. This was perfect.
                        This would get her to notice me.<br><br>
                        It confessed my love and admiration, my devotion and adoration. It was a love poem in the style
                        of Chaucer and Shakespeare and all the great writers of love and affection. It would have to get
                        me noticed.<br><br>
                        I carefully pushed the canvas into the transport box I had acquired and snapped the opaque box
                        shut before lifting it onto a wheeled gurney for movement to my truck. I stripped myself of the
                        surgeon's costumer and dressed in my usual jeans, jacket and a knit hat as well as gloves for my
                        hands since it was supposed rather chilly tonight and I didn't want to catch a cold before I met
                        her. It wouldn't do to make her sick.<br><br>
                        The gurney moved with oiled quiet to the truck where I lifted the box onto the tarp I had laid
                        in the trunk. It settled with a quiet thunk and I threw the gurney back into the building. I
                        grabbed a few bright orange cans and proceeded to cover the place with gas. I didn't want to be
                        caught before I could get my message to her. I lit the place and moved on. It would burn to the
                        ground in a blaze of old rotted wood and condemned insulation. I'd be safe long enough.<br><br>
                        'I wish I may, I wish I might'<br><br>
                        I had delivered my message and gone home to watch the news in anticipation. It hadn't been quick
                        but within a day or two it had hit the media. A picture of the canvas from before she had been
                        used was shown. That was infuriating. I wanted her to know that the message was meant for her,
                        not for the media to just report her dead. I growled and threw the remote, something I never do.<br><br>
                        I waited.<br><br>
                        Days went by.<br><br>
                        Then a week.<br><br>
                        After two and a half weeks of waiting, a knock sounded on my door.<br><br>
                        It was her, it had to be her. I couldn't quell the rush of excitement that swelled in my stomach
                        as I raced to the door. I smoothed my hair, set my shirt and tie just right to look suave and
                        dashing and opened the door.<br><br>
                        It was two men in jackets. Hard looking men, with her nowhere in sight. I grimaced and went to
                        shut the door.<br><br>
                        “Sir, are you Deacon Homes?” The shorter one spoke. I nodded.<br><br>
                        “We're NYPD, we'd like to take you down to the station to ask you a few questions about Amanda
                        Fresno. Can you come with us?” He asked, as if I have all the time in the world.<br><br>
                        “No.”<br><br>
                        “Sir, we can either bring you in as a relevant witness or we can bring you in as a primary
                        suspect, it's your choice really,” the taller one this time.<br><br>
                        “Fine,” I consented to letting them haul me off. I'll see what they want and then I'll be back
                        her in time to greet her. I grabbed my jacket and hat and went with them. As we reached the car
                        they'd come in, I noticed it wasn't a normal police cruiser. Was it possible they weren't really
                        NYPD. I hadn't seen a badge, but then I hadn't asked really. I disregarded it for the moment.<br><br>
                        We came to the precinct and I stepped out slightly. No one grabbed me, no one tried to arrest
                        me, they just kind of guided me to the nearest interrogation room. I smirked, they had nothing
                        but the signature and even that was explainable. I'd only done that to allow for her to finally
                        know my name.<br><br>
                        “Do you know why you're here Deacon?” the short one asked me. His tone was all wrong though, too
                        nice, much nicer than back at the apartment. And he sat across from me, a small file on the
                        table. I didn't trust my voice at this stage, if I was caught and sent away, she'd never know it
                        was me. I just shook my head.<br><br>
                        The detective removed a picture from the file; it was of the canvas, from before. I gripped it
                        slowly and peered at it, trying to write confusion on my face. From their looks, it was working.<br><br>
                        “I think, yeah I did. I met her a while back. But we just met for coffee and,” I hesitated,
                        trying to make myself sound nervous and a bit embarrassed, “we also, um,” I drew out the word a
                        little before falling silent.<br><br>
                        “Did you have sex with her Deacon?” The taller one asked, his voice was harder than at my
                        apartment. I tried to play surprised and shame. He seemed to buy it for now. I nodded this time,
                        again worried that my voice would give me away. They shared a look.<br><br>
                        “What happened after?” The gentle voice prodded for more details.<br><br>
                        “I just, thanked her for her time and we went our separate ways. I didn't see her after that.
                        Then I saw her on the news, but I didn't want to call or anything because I didn't want to be a
                        suspect or arrested. I didn't do anything, it was just sex. We met on an online chat room and
                        agreed to meet,” I started babbling, “next thing I know we're in bed and it's amazing, but that
                        was it. I didn't know what to do.” I let a small choked sound that could have been a sob. I was
                        really just biting my tongue.<br><br>
                        “And you have no idea who she was going to see afterwards?” I shook my head.<br><br>
                        “Thank you for your time Mr. Homes. Have a nice day,” I stood, my heart beating like a drum. I
                        couldn't hear much over the rush of blood in my ears, but it had worked. I was getting let go.
                        I'd be able to actually go and see her finally. I smiled.<br><br>
                        As I left the station I ran straight to the subway and caught a ride home, my chest quivering
                        with relief. I'd done it, I'd sent the most perfect message and I'd gotten away with it. Now I
                        could sit back and relax and let her come to me.<br><br>
                        'receive the wish I wish tonight'<br><br>
                        Only she didn't. She never sent any response. I quickly became morose, depressed, unkempt and
                        distressed.<br><br>
                        'She just hasn't seen it yet,' I thought to myself, 'they're withholding it until they have more
                        evidence. If she'd seen it, she'd have come here by now.' I paced the apartment. I didn't go to
                        work, I stayed home, just in case. The wall began to slowly fill up as new letters were thought
                        of and discarded.<br><br>
                        Then, I turned to the news. There was a new one. A new letter. But I hadn't done it, it wasn't
                        my hand that wrote this letter. The canvas was all wrong. It was a man. The reporter droned on
                        and on about the canvas' life from before. Then a picture was shown. He looked a little like me.
                        I could feel confusion sweeping through me.<br><br>
                        It took forever, but I finally the message that had been written onto the blank canvas was read
