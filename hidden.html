                            <div id="home-title" name="home-title"></div> The door whispered quietly as it closed. The ray
                            of
                            bright white light that had streamed in from
                            the hall and pierced the gloom, quickly vanished. She struggled slightly against the restraints
                            on the bed she lay upon. Her body was covered in naught but the thin dress she had been wearing
                            at the party before. She gazed upon the visage of her captor.<br><br>
                            He was not a tall man, of average height, but he moved with purpose. He didn't slow his stride
                            or shy away from his intended motion. She could almost sense the predatory mind within as his
                            hands drifted over a table that lay just out of sight. He turned his head to her, a smirk
                            crossing his features. She hated what that smirk did to her.<br><br>
                            And she couldn't help what it did to her, or that she wanted more. All the time. Her captor
                            tormented constantly with thoughts and words of what he could do with nothing but a few
                            sentences. He held power over her, and she had surrendered completely again and again.<br><br>
                            “You've been very naughty, Darling,” he purred. She felt shivers race down her spine. She knew
                            that voice well, it promised much and said little at the same time.<br><br>
                            “I requested a very specific set of lingerie,” he continued, his lips barely moving, but she
                            heard his words all the same. She felt a finger trace up her thigh, barely touching the fabric
                            of her dress. She moaned, but it was muffled by the gag over her mouth. He lifted his finger to
                            his lips and then leaned down to her ear.<br><br>
                            “You wore nothing, thinking I would enjoy it,” he murmured, his hot breath tickling her ear. She
                            turned her face to look him in the eyes.<br><br>
                            “Oh, I do, you know that,” he whispered, stroking a thumb down the side of her face. She leaned
                            into the touch, unable to help herself. She could feel the liquid heat start to build in the pit
                            of her stomach. With a sudden jerk, he held her chin in his fist, his eyes boring directly into
                            hers.<br><br>
                            “But, when daddy wants to see his babygirl in a specific set of lingerie. It is not because he
                            wants to see her in nothing. Your impatience is going to cost you. That'll be ten lashes.” His
                            eyes were lit from within by a dark passion. She moaned again, quieter, as she felt his rough
                            hands quickly work her restraints over so she lay with her bared behind in the air.<br><br>
                            She heard the ghostly trails of leather upon stone and she closed her eyes. The first one always
                            managed to ignite a spark in her that set fire to her veins. She waited, fingers clench in
                            anticipation. Daddy would punish her as he saw fit, and then he would take care of her, as he
                            always did. She would learn this lesson well, just like all the others.<br><br>
                            A sudden sharp spike of warmth and pain, she moaned once more. His fingers traced the red mark
                            left behind, and she held still, knowing if she moved he would stop. There was no pause between
                            the second and third lashing, one on each cheek. She cried out through the gag, pain searing her
                            for a moment, then she felt a warmth seep between her legs and she moaned, trying to rub her
                            legs together on instinct. He gripped her hair, pulling it tight and brought his whispers back
                            to her ear.<br><br>
                            “You don't get to move, Darling. That's the rule. I think you need some time to think before I
                            administer the rest of the lashes.” He said.<br><br>
                            She moaned and tried to turn to look at him, pleading in her eyes to continue. He once more bore
                            the damnable smirk. She didn't care at this point, she wanted him to finish the punishment. She
                            needed him to complete the lesson.<br><br>
                            She craned her neck slightly to see his silhouette on the wall. She watched as his shadow placed
                            the flog back upon the table before reaching up to his neck, a few quick jerks and she knew he
                            had loosened his tie. She heard his shoe heels quietly clicking as she stepped around.<br><br>
                            He crouched in front of her, gazing into her half lidded eyes. The warmth in stomach, which had
                            been receding, now slowly surged forward again as he simply looked at her. She could see
                            possessiveness and desire behind the fire in his eyes. She shivered once, as she realized the
                            cause of those emotions.<br><br>
                            Her. Those eyes were meant solely for her, and she shivered again. A ghostly trail, whispering
                            down her spine. The liquid heat in her lower stomach rolled and kicked, she felt her legs grow
                            damp once more. He smiled softly, and stood. He knew exactly what he had done to her and she
                            didn't care.<br><br>
                            She heard a slight knocking sound and then, a line of red fire flashed across both her asscheeks
                            and she moaned again, the gag dulling the sound. She heard the next swing whipping backwards
                            through the air, before he brought the riding crop down again across her bare cheeks. He laid
                            the crop upon her two more times before he put the tool down.<br><br>
                            She shuddered in ecstasy as she felt his rough hands soothing the heat and kneading at the
                            exposed skin. A lightning bolt rippled through her. She heard a single soft laugh.<br><br>
                            “So close to the edge already,” he murmured loud enough for her to hear. She nodded as he
                            continued to massage her. He drew out another moan from her before she stiffened as a single
                            digit stroked down her lips, tweaking slightly at the end to barely brush her clit.<br><br>
                            The first wave of the orgasm hit her without warning, a wall of darkness and pleasure, as she
                            felt her pussy loosen and dampen. She shuddered in time with the muscles of her stomach as the
                            small orgasm seared her, readying her for his assault.<br><br>
                            “You came before you were told. I know you couldn't control that one, but I don't want you
                            having all the fun without me,” his voice was sibilant in her ear, coiling the liquid heat
                            within her once more. She sighed as she strained against the cords to be closer to him. She
                            could smell him along with her own release. It was heady and pleasing.<br><br>
                            His finger lightly teased at the opening of her pussy, causing small spasms in her legs as he
                            would brush near to sensitive spots. She had already given most of her secrets to him. He had
                            discovered more than even she had known. He delighted in this, slow and deliberate
                            torture.<br><br>
                            “I'm going to make you come, again and again. Until your mind is nothing but thought of me and
                            the pleasure,” he whispered to her, his finger and thumb had sought out her clit, teasing
                            lightly at it. She moaned his name into the gag, shuddering at his movements. The heat within
                            had begun building again, an inferno that he stoked to life with mere words and motions.<br><br>
                            “Scream as loud as you like, no one will hear you,” he said as he slipped a finger inside of
                            her.
                            She moaned again as he moved slowly. Too slowly for her, she bucked once and he held her hips
                            down.<br><br>
                            “Now now, you don't get to control that, I do,” he murmured as he withdrew his finger. She
                            whimpered at the loss and then gasped slightly as pressure held her down from the back. She felt
                            the rough rope coil twice over her, holding her in place tightly. She felt him check the knot
                            and then let go. She whimpered to him. A moment later, the whimpers deepened and drew out as he
                            slipped his finger back inside her.<br><br>
                            “You're so wet already and I've barely begun. I am very pleased,” he said. She felt him slowly
                            brushing against her inner walls and groaned as another wave began to grow within her. He pushed
                            his finger all the way inside her, and then she spasmed as his thumb moved forward to brush her
                            clit once more.<br><br>
                            He idly brushed her clit a few times without moving his finger from it's spot. She felt the wave
                            respond each time, growing higher and higher. Her muscles were slowly tightening one by one as
                            the heat flared within her. She ached for release, her body quivering. And just as slowly as he
                            drew her to the edge again, he leaned forward.<br><br>
                            She felt his arm, muscular and firm, wrap around her throat and she stiffened.<br><br>
                            “Come for me.”<br><br>
                            She screamed through the gag as the wave crashed over her, searing her mind, body and soul. She
                            arched backwards as her air dwindled. She felt the wave crashing harder and harder with each
                            firm thrust of his hand. The heat within her was burning her alive and she felt her senses
                            slowly dim one by one as she was consumed in a haze of pleasure and warmth. The wave slowly
                            receded and she relaxed her body, her muscles quivering from the strain.<br><br>
                            “I'm not even close to done,” he purred in her ear. The damnable and oh so desired warmth flared
                            to life once more, his words fanning the guttering spark and setting it crackling anew.<br><br>
                            She moaned again as he finally withdrew his fingers. The feeling of emptiness was aching and she
                            wanted him to fill her up once more, but she knew if she moved, he'd drag the end farther and
                            farther away.<br><br>
                            “You were a very good girl, and for that, I'll remove the gag. I want to hear you scream my name
                            as I play with you,” he said as his fingers deftly worked the ties on the gag. Moments later
                            cool fresh air streamed through her lips and she quickly wet them once more as she felt his
                            fingers brush light trails over her back in intricate patterns.<br><br>
                            She refrained from speaking yet. He had already taught her not to speak before it was time and
                            she would be good for him. She waited patiently as he continued to trace her back as he walked
                            slowly towards the table once more. She heard the whisper of leather once more. She trembled in
                            anticipation.<br><br>
                            “Are you ready for the last three?” His tone was sweet and low, setting her mind aflame with
                            memories of that voice. She could only nod, not trusting her voice just yet. But her would bring
                            it out
                            of her, he always did.<br><br>
                            She felt the first and second close together, the heat resurging as she moaned. She wasn't ready
                            to give words as she felt the wave begin to surge in her.
                            “I can't hear you Darling,” he whispered in her ear. She moaned once more and a single word
                            passed her lips.<br><br>
                            “Please.” She whimpered slightly as he stayed very still, not moving a single muscle. She turned
                            to look towards him.<br><br>
                            “Please, please make me come.” His eyes darkened and he smiled at her.<br><br>
                            “If that is your wish,” he said. Her eyes widened as she felt his finger slip inside her once
                            more, delving deep for the spot that erased all thought. He stood and she sensed what was coming
                            even as the wave began to tower over her.<br><br>
                            “Come for me, come as hard as you can for me.” She shivered at the huskiness in his voice even
                            as she felt him curve a finger and then her world disappeared in pleasure. She felt the wave
                            rise and rise, and she couldn't seem to find it's top.<br><br>
                            A line of fire seared her and the wave crested, crashing down upon her once more, drowning her
                            in warmth and light. She heard him murmuring to her, but the blood rushing in her ears drowned
                            out the world to her as she came again and again around him. She could feel her muscles
                            trembling for mercy even as the waves subsided, slowly receding back once more.<br><br>
                            She lay exhausted and spent upon the table as he slowly kneaded at her back, relaxing and
                            rolling away the tensed muscles. Even so, she felt the guttering spark, waiting to burst aflame
                            once more.<br><br>
                            * <a href="#home-title"> <i class="fa-solid fa-house"></i></a> *

                            He stepped forward into the light, unbuttoning his sleeves and carefully rolling them up. He
                            gazed down at the sleeping beauty that lay in repose on his bed. He turned quietly and picked up
                            a small wooden box which he placed on the small night table next to the bed.<br><br>
                            The woman stirred but did not wake, merely shifting in her sleep. The silken covers drifted down
                            to reveal her nude form beneath them, his gaze was drawn to the curve of her back, which shifted
                            to disappear beneath the draped fabric. His eyes snapped back to the box and a soft smile
                            alighted his features. He opened the top and carefully selected a single set of handcuffs,
                            placing them quietly on the table in front of the box.<br><br>
                            He also removed a simple ball gag and dark blind fold from the wood and closed it, placing them
                            in a precise line with the cuffs. He gazed at them for a moment before turning back to the bed
                            whilst unbuttoning the top of his shirt.<br><br>
                            He sat down on the side of the bed, gently tracing circles over the woman's back, his fingertips
                            tingling from the smooth skin. He carefully arranged her arms behind her back and slowly slipped
                            the cuffs over her wrists. She moaned slightly in her sleep, but didn't wake still. He slipped
                            the blindfold over her eyes quickly.<br><br>
                            He smirked slightly as he began to use his thumbs to apply pressure to her lower back, she
                            shifted. He began to knead in small circles over her shoulders, eliciting a soft moan from her.
                            He quickly slipped the gag into her mouth before she could attempt to roll over and he pinned
                            her down, continuing to add pressure to her shoulders, she moaned louder around the gag.<br><br>
                            “Good morning sweety,” he whispered into her ear. She leaned her head back as he slowly nipped
                            at her neck. She writhed under his hands as he slowly worked his hands lower down her
                            back.<br><br>
                            “I've been thinking about this all night while I was out,” He whispered to her. His hands
                            suddenly stopped and he took a deep breath. He could smell her soap on her skin as he gripped
                            her neck with one hand and pulled her close to him. He bit down on her pulse point, drawing yet
                            another shuddering moan from her.<br><br>
                            “I couldn't remove your taste from my mind,” he murmured into her ear as he tightened his hold
                            on her throat. His other hand slipped under the covers and drifted over her legs before he
                            grabbed her hips and rolled her on her side. He shifted his arm across her throat as he slowly
                            drew his finger over her stomach. She arched her back as he carefully traced over the hood of
                            her clit.<br><br>
                            She let loose an even louder moan as he slowly lowered his finger and teased at her entrance.
                            He could feel her tense, her muscles quivering against him. He withdrew his hands and slowly
                            leaned back, sitting up properly. He stroked her back before sliding the sheet up and over her
                            ass. He lightly kneaded it before releasing her soft flesh.<br><br>
                            He smiled properly as he raised his hand and delivered a quick smack to her left cheek. She
                            moaned around the gag, but he held her down roughly as he swiftly recreated the hand mark on her
                            other cheek. She whimpered as he laid another smack to her already reddening skin. He gently
                            massaged at the tender skin, reveling in the heat he had drawn to the surface. He carefully
                            traced his own handprint over her flesh delighting in the sound her moans made as he finished
                            each line. He slipped his hand down the cleft and between her legs to find her soaking
                            wet.<br><br>


                            He traced over her pussy lips with one hand as he slid his arm back around her throat. She
                            turned her head slightly as he nibbled on her shoulder. He slid his finger inside her as he bit
                            down on her pulse. She trembled against him as he teased her with small motions.<br><br>
                            “I've been wanting to make you scream all night,” he whispered to her as he flicked her clit
                            between two fingers, eliciting a soft shivering from her. He removed the gag and took a deep
                            breath in as her moans and whispers of pleading flowed over him like music.<br><br>
                            He slid his arm back over her neck after placing the gag on the table. He applied pressure as he
                            continued to softly flick her clit back and forth. He could feel her muscles tightening against
                            him and he knew what was coming. He had enjoyed himself but he wanted to make her
                            scream.<br><br>
                            He could feel the dampness under his hand growing and he desired to taste it. He withdrew his
                            arm and carefully arranged her so she was kneeling with her ass in the air. He carefully
                            approached her, holding the cuffs with one hand. He flicked his tongue out, a quick taste, and
                            she whimpered his name.<br><br>
                            He grew more daring and slowly ran the flat of his tongue along her slit, taking a full taste of
                            her sweetness. He always grew hungry as he devoured her. This time was no different. His tongue
                            darted forward, thrusting its way into her. He moaned slightly at her taste and she moaned in
                            response to the vibrations.<br><br>
                            He took his time, exploring the depths of her pussy with his tongue as her cries grew louder and
                            louder. His tongue darted down, to encircle her clit, freeing it from the torturous circles his
                            thumb had been making. He felt her skin grow warm as she strained against him. Her voice
                            deafened everything, screaming his name.<br><br>
                            He unclipped the cuffs with one hand as he continued to lavish attention upon her. She reached
                            up to grip the pillows, burying her face in the silken case. Her screams grew intensely, but
                            were muted. He stood quickly, grabbing a handful of her hair and roughly pulled her away from
                            them.<br><br>
                            “Daddy wants to hear your screams. No muffling them,” his voice was deep, growling in her ear
                            almost. She moaned at the tight grip and let out a small cry of pleasure at the sensation of his
                            hand striking her bare ass twice in rapid succession.<br><br>
                            “Yes Daddy, I'm so sorry. I'll be good Daddy,” she cried out. He grinned and kept his hold on
                            her hair as he slipped a finger inside of her once more. She moaned, long and loud, drenching
                            his finger
                            . He curled it, pressing that sweet spot inside her and she tensed, he softly stroked the spot,
                            drawing out small moans and cries from her.<br><br>
                            “Come for me baby,” he murmured to her, stroking harder. She begin to shiver, but he held her
                            hair tight, pressing harder at the sweet spot, willing her to come.<br><br>
                            “Come for daddy,” he whispered. Her back arched and a soft cry started that grew louder as he
                            continued his attack. In moments her skin flushed red and she shuddered, her voice cracking
                            slightly as he slowed finally, withdrawing from her. She moaned at the loss of contact.<br><br>
                            He reached for the box and opened it, withdrawing a small leathr ring belt which he looped over
                            her neck. He quickly undid his pants and crawled on the bed behind her. He pulled the belt a
                            little, tightening it slightly. He leaned forward over her and whispered into her ear.<br><br>
                            “Are you ready for Daddy to fuck you?” He slowly pressed the head of his cock against her. She
                            moaned and shifted her hips, rubbing her slit against him. Her dampness clung to his skin as he
                            pressed his way into her, slowly sheathing his member. He moaned as the walls gripped him
                            tightly, ensnaring his senses.<br><br>
                            Lust descended over him as he moved quickly, setting a blistering pace. He pulled the belt
                            tight, pounding into pussy. She could barely scream over the belt, but he kept it just loose
                            enough for her to draw ragged breaths when he slowed slightly.<br><br>
                            He gripped her hips tightly as he drove himself closer and closer to the edge. He wound the belt
                            once around his hand and pulled it tighter as he leaned forward, keeping the pace.<br><br>
                            “Daddy wants you to swallow every last drop. Can you do that for him Sweety?” He murmured into
                            her ear. She could barely nod yes as her pussy tightened over his cock. He felt her come on him
                            twice in quick succession as he neared his end. He loosened the belt even as he slowed his pace,
                            drawing her to one more orgasm.<br><br>
                            He pulled out and she groaned slightly as her muscles protested her roll over. He position his
                            cock over her and she licked her lips before enveloping the head in her hot wet mouth. His head
                            rolled back as her hand stroked the shaft, feeling the soft skin slickly gliding under her
                            hands. He moaned as he felt the first shot welling up. He looked down at her as she focused on
                            her task.<br><br>
                            “I'm going to come for you baby, ready?” He whispered, running a hand over her hair. She kept
                            her rhythm as he grunted. He filled her mouth and she eagerly swallowed him down. Her hands
                            gripped him as he slowly shuddered. She made a small suction noise as she swallowed every last
                            drop of him. He rolled his head as he looked down at her.
                            “Very good Sweety, Daddy is very happy with you.” he murmured as he leant down and pecked her.
                            She smiled widely and lay back, letting him strip off his shirt and lay beside her. He clutched
                            her closely to him and sighed, exhausted and spent, but relaxed and for the moment, carefree.
